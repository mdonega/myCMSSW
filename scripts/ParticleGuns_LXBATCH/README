Some instructions to run cmsRun (in this case for GEN) on lxbatch

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Files description:

jobba.sh                           : steering script (takes care of: cmsenv, export the autentification, sets the output names used by the EGM-RunIIWinter15GS-00004_1_cfg.py)
EGM-RunIIWinter15GS-00004_1_cfg.py : example file to generate a particle gun with PU (takes care of the random number seeds and output naming)
run_jobba.sh                       : set the queues and submit the jobs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BEFORE YOU START YOU NEED:
- storage space on eos: http://eos.web.cern.ch/content/using-eos-cern
- a valid proxy:
  > voms-proxy-init --voms cms --valid 168:00
  You should get something like:
      	[mdonega@lxplus0012] ~/work >voms-proxy-init --voms cms --valid 168:00
        Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:
	Contacting lcg-voms2.cern.ch:15002 [/DC=ch/DC=cern/OU=computers/CN=lcg-voms2.cern.ch] "cms"...
	Remote VOMS server contacted succesfully.
        Created proxy in /tmp/x509up_u9880.

  Then Copy /tmp/x509up_u9880 in your home
  > cp -p /tmp/x509up_u9880 ~/.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First setup the release you need
> cmsrel CMSSW_7_4_0
> cd CMSSW_7_4_0
> mkdir batch
> cd batch

Get the Files above and copy them in CMSSW_7_4_0/batch (or wherever you prefer)

Set the number of events you want per job: 
    process.maxEvents = cms.untracked.PSet(
        input = cms.untracked.int32(5)
	)

Modify the user name in jobba.sh. (you will find mdonega for afs and donega for eos... don't ask it's a long story. You probably have just one account, just replace both with your $USERNAME)

Done !

Try one job locally:
> jobba 1

At this point it's useful to mount eos locally:
cd ~/
mkdir eos
eosmount eos

and check the output:
ls /eos/cms/store/user/donega/tmp/

If you got to this point you can submit the jobs on lxbatch:
Modify  run_jobba.sh:
- set the queue you want 
- set the number of jobs you want here: e.g. 1000 --> for i in `seq 1 1000`; 
- set your the email address (ideally you should receive a mail once the job is done... For some reasons I never get the mail)

Finally
> run_jobba.sh

To monitor your jobs you can use command line tools:
> bjobs
> bpeek [-f] [-q queue_name | -m host_name | -J job_name | job_ID | "job_ID[index_list]"]

Or webbased tools:  (look for your username)
